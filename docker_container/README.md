# Docker
Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run container applications.

Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that share the host system's kernel.

Unlike VM's that includes a full operating system, Containers visalize the user space which is the part of the operating system where applications run. Including the file system, processes and networking.

Within a container, the application runs as a process (or multiple processes) isolated from the host system and other containers.
