# Tmux

tmux is a terminal multiplexer.
It allows you to create several "pseudo terminals" from a single terminal.
It has a lot of more than simply split your terminal to panes.

## Tmux general advantages
- Run multiple terminal sessions in a single window and even a single session.
- Detach sessions and keep programs running in the background.
- Reattach to sessions from any terminal, allowing remote multiple accesses.
- Customize the status bar to display relevant information.
- Script and automate tmux sessions for different tasks.

## Tmux disadvantage
- Many sessions and terminals can be hidden from sight.
- History requires additional configurations to save them.
